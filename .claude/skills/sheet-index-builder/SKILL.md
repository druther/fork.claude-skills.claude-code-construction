name: sheet-index-builder
description: Build or update a navigable index of construction drawing sheets using vision-based title block reading. Use when no sheet index exists, when new drawings are added, or when asked to list or catalog drawing sheets. Triggers on 'index drawings', 'list sheets', 'what drawings do we have', or 'update sheet index'.

# Sheet Index Builder

Creates a YAML index of every drawing sheet with number, title, discipline, scale, revision, and page location. This index is the foundation for all drawing navigation.

## Step 1: Detect Data Mode

Check for `.construction/` directory in the project root. See parent CLAUDE.md for the full graph-guided cascade and tool reference.

### AgentCM Fast Path

**If `.construction/index/sheet_index.yaml` exists**: The index is already built by the platform. Read it and present the summary:
- Total sheet count by discipline
- Sheets with missing titles or "unknown" discipline (may need manual review)
- Any sheets marked with non-standard numbering

Only rebuild if the user explicitly requests it or new drawing files are detected that aren't in the index.

**If AgentCM graph also exists**: Read `.construction/graph/graph_summary.yaml` to report additional context — how many views, rooms, elements, and callout edges are associated with the indexed sheets.

### Vision Build Path (No AgentCM)

Build from scratch using vision + PDF tools on title blocks.

## Workflow (Vision Build)

```
Index Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Find all drawing PDFs
- [ ] Step 2: Rasterize title block region of each page
- [ ] Step 3: Extract sheet data via vision
- [ ] Step 4: Validate and deduplicate
- [ ] Step 5: Write sheet_index.yaml
- [ ] Step 6: Write graph entry
```

### Step 1: Find Drawing PDFs

Locate PDFs in drawing folders. A PDF is a drawing if:
- It's in a folder classified as a drawing container, OR
- Its filename matches a sheet number pattern (e.g., `A-2.01*.pdf`), OR
- Quick vision check of page 1 shows a title block border

### Step 2: Rasterize Title Block Region

Title blocks are in the bottom-right corner of drawing sheets (typically the rightmost 4" × 2" at 150 DPI).

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../bin/construction-python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/pdf/rasterize_page.py INPUT.pdf PAGE_NUM --output title_block.png
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../bin/construction-python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/pdf/crop_region.py title_block.png --anchor bottom-right --width 1200 --height 600 --output tb_crop.png
```

For bound sets (multi-page PDFs), process every page.

### Step 3: Extract Sheet Data via Vision

Use vision on the cropped title block image to extract:

```yaml
sheet_number: "A-2.01"          # e.g., A-2.01, S-3.02, M-1.01
sheet_title: "FIRST FLOOR PLAN" # title from title block
discipline: "Architectural"     # derived from prefix
scale: "1/4\" = 1'-0\""         # primary scale noted
revision: "3"                   # current revision number
revision_date: "2025-03-15"     # date of current revision
```

**Discipline prefix mapping** — see `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../reference/drawing_conventions.md`.

### Step 4: Validate and Deduplicate

- Check for duplicate sheet numbers (same sheet in multiple files = revision conflict)
- Verify discipline prefix matches folder classification
- Flag sheets with unreadable title blocks for manual review

### Step 5: Write Index

Write to `.construction/index/sheet_index.yaml`:

```yaml
sheets:
  - number: "A-2.01"
    title: "FIRST FLOOR PLAN"
    discipline: "Architectural"
    scale: "1/4\" = 1'-0\""
    revision: "3"
    revision_date: "2025-03-15"
    file_path: "Drawings/Architectural/A-2.01.pdf"
    page: 1
    bound_set: false
```

### Step 6: Write Graph Entry

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../bin/construction-python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/graph/write_finding.py \
  --type "sheet_index_built" \
  --title "Sheet index created" \
  --data '{"sheet_count": N, "disciplines": ["A","S","M","E","P"]}'
```

## Tips

- For large bound sets (100+ pages), batch rasterization: process 10 pages at a time
- If a title block is rotated or non-standard, fall back to full-page vision
- Civil sheets may use `C-` prefix and engineering scales (1"=20', etc.)
- Some projects use alternate numbering (e.g., `AD-101` for Addendum sheets)
