## Test Case Format

Each test case is a JSON file:

```json
{
  "id": "schedule-extractor-01",
  "skill": "schedule-extractor",
  "name": "Door schedule extraction from A-0.01",

## Test Cases by Skill

### P0: project-onboarding

| Case | Input | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Full project folder with drawings, specs, RFIs | File classification accuracy, discipline detection, folder structure recognition |
| 02 | Minimal folder (just a bound drawing set PDF) | Handles single-file projects, detects bound set, triggers sheet indexing |
| 03 | Messy folder (mixed naming, nested subfolders) | Robustness with non-standard organization |

**Key metrics:**
- File type classification accuracy (% correct)
- Discipline detection accuracy
- Document type detection accuracy
- Time to complete indexing

### P0: sheet-index-builder

| Case | Input | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | 10 individual sheet PDFs with standard title blocks | Sheet number, title, scale, discipline extraction accuracy |
| 02 | Bound set (100+ page PDF) | Multi-page PDF handling, page-to-sheet mapping |
| 03 | Non-standard title blocks (different firms) | Robustness with varied title block formats |

**Key metrics:**
- Sheet number extraction accuracy (% exact match)
- Sheet title accuracy (fuzzy match, >90% character accuracy)
- Scale extraction accuracy
- Discipline classification accuracy

### P1: schedule-extractor

| Case | Input | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Door schedule (standard format) | Column detection, row extraction, cell value accuracy |
| 02 | Window schedule | Different column structure, handling merged headers |
| 03 | Room finish schedule | Finish code interpretation, multi-column layout |
| 04 | Panel schedule (electrical) | Dense numerical data, circuit/load extraction |
| 05 | Schedule across page break | Detecting continuation, merging results |

**Key metrics:**
- Column header detection (exact match)
- Row count accuracy (within ±5%)
- Cell value accuracy per column (% exact match)
- Excel output validity (opens correctly, data in right cells)

**Ground truth creation:** Manually transcribe 100% of the schedule into a reference spreadsheet. Compare extracted values cell-by-cell.

### P1: submittal-log-generator

| Case | Input | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | 5 individual spec section PDFs | Submittal paragraph detection, item parsing, type classification |
| 02 | Bound project manual (50+ sections) | TOC parsing, section boundary detection, long-running stability |
| 03 | Specs with addenda modifications | Addendum detection, submittal requirement updates |

**Key metrics:**
- Submittal item detection recall (% of actual items found)
- Submittal type classification accuracy
- Spec section/paragraph reference accuracy
- Excel output validity and completeness
- Comparison against manually-created submittal log

### P1: code-compliance-checker

| Case | Input | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Floor plan — egress review | Occupant load calc, exit count, travel distance, corridor width |
| 02 | Floor plan — ADA review | Door clearances, accessible routes, restroom layout |
| 03 | Section/detail — fire rating review | Wall ratings, opening protectives, rated assembly continuity |

**Key metrics:**
- Code section citation accuracy (correct IBC/ADA section referenced)
- Finding validity (human review: true positive / false positive / missed)
- Jurisdiction identification (correct state/local code edition)
- Severity classification appropriateness

**Important:** Code compliance findings must be validated by a licensed professional. Eval measures whether the skill flags the right areas, not whether its determination is final.

### P1: bid-tabulator

| Case | Input | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | 8 bid PDFs for single scope (text-layer) | Bidder detection, base bid extraction, line item capture, exclusions/qualifications, scope gap flagging |
| 02 | Scanned bid PDFs (no text layer) | Vision fallback, data extraction from rasterized pages, [unclear] flagging |
| 03 | Bids with alternates, unit prices, allowances | Alternate extraction (add/deduct), unit price capture with units, cross-bidder alignment |

**Key metrics:**
- Base bid amount accuracy (within $1 tolerance)
- Line item recall (% of actual items captured per bidder)
- Exclusion/qualification recall
- Scope gap detection (items in some bids but not others)
- No normalization of as-submitted data (engineer handles this)
- Excel output validity (all required tabs, low bid highlighted)

**Ground truth:** Manually extract all data from each bid PDF — base amounts, line items, exclusions, qualifications, alternates, unit prices.

### P1: code-researcher (replaces code-compliance-checker)

| Case | Input | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Floor plan — egress research | Jurisdiction identification, IBC egress section citations, research framing (not compliance) |
| 02 | Floor plan — accessibility research | Multi-standard coverage (ADA + ANSI A117.1 + state), layered requirements |
| 03 | Floor plans — fire protection research | IBC Chapter 7 + NFPA 13/72/101 citations, construction type table references |

**Key metrics:**
- Jurisdiction accuracy (correct state/local code edition identified)
- Code citation accuracy (correct IBC/NFPA/ADA section references)
- Topic coverage (% of relevant research topics included)
- Research framing (zero COMPLIANT/NON-COMPLIANT determinations — all informational)
- Uncertainty handling (findings tagged confirmed/needs_review/uncertain appropriately)
- Human-in-the-loop (outline presented for user confirmation before deep research)

**Important:** This is a RESEARCH tool, not a compliance checker. Eval measures whether the skill identifies the right codes and requirements, not whether it makes compliance determinations. All findings must be framed as informational research for PE/architect review.

**Ground truth:** Licensed PE/architect documents applicable codes, editions, jurisdiction amendments, and code section references for each research topic.

### P1: subcontract-writer

| Case | Input | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | .docx template + specs — finishes scope | Template parsing, template preservation, spec section references, drawing references |
| 02 | No template — structural steel scope | Fallback document generation, article structure, Division 05 references, placeholder handling |
| 03 | PDF template + specs — HVAC scope | PDF template parsing, trade-specific language, multi-discipline drawing references |

**Key metrics:**
- Template preservation (standard clauses unchanged)
- Spec section reference accuracy (correct CSI sections for scope)
- Drawing sheet reference accuracy
- Contract documents list completeness and order
- Professional language quality (human-rated)
- .docx output validity

**Ground truth:** PM reviews generated subcontract against firm template and project documents. Scores on scope reference completeness, template fidelity, and language quality.

### P2: cross-reference-navigator

| Case | Input | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Follow 5 detail callouts from a floor plan | Target sheet/detail resolution accuracy |
| 02 | Batch resolve all references on one sheet | Completeness of reference detection |
| 03 | Follow a chain (plan → section → detail) | Multi-hop traversal |

**Key metrics:**
- Reference detection recall
- Target resolution accuracy (correct sheet + detail number)
- Chain traversal completeness

## Scoring Framework

### Per-Case Score

Each case produces a score from 0.0 to 1.0 based on weighted metrics defined in the case JSON.

### Per-Skill Score

Average of all case scores for that skill, weighted by case complexity:
- Simple cases (single file, single operation): weight 1.0
- Medium cases (multiple files, multi-step): weight 1.5
- Complex cases (long-running, cross-document): weight 2.0

### Overall Score

Weighted average of per-skill scores:
- P0 skills: weight 3.0 (foundational — everything depends on these)
- P1 skills: weight 2.0 (core value — these are the money skills)
- P2 skills: weight 1.5
- P3 skills: weight 1.0

### Score Interpretation

| Score | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 0.9+ | Production-ready for this task |
| 0.7-0.9 | Useful with human review of outputs |
| 0.5-0.7 | Needs iteration — skill instructions need refinement |
| <0.5 | Fundamental approach needs rework |

## Ground Truth Creation Guide

When providing construction documents for evals, also create ground truth for each test case:

### For schedule extraction:
- Manually transcribe the full schedule into a CSV/XLSX
- Note merged cells, multi-line entries, and special characters

### For submittal log:
- Manually extract all submittal items from spec sections
- Note the spec paragraph reference, type, and description for each

### For sheet index:
- Manually record sheet number, title, discipline, and scale for each sheet

### For code compliance:
- Have a licensed architect/PE review the drawings and note actual compliance issues
- Record code section references for each finding

### For quantity takeoff:
- Manually count the target items on each sheet
- Note the exact count and any ambiguous items

### For cross-references:
- Manually trace all callouts and record source → target mappings

### For bid tabulation:
- Manually extract from each bid PDF: company name, base bid amount, all line items (as-submitted), exclusions, qualifications, alternates (with add/deduct), unit prices (with units)
- Create per-bidder CSVs with exact values from the documents

### For code research:
- Licensed PE/architect documents applicable codes, correct editions, jurisdiction amendments
- Record code section references for each research topic
- Note which requirements are federal baseline vs state/local additions

### For subcontract writing:
- PM reviews generated document against firm template and project specs
- Verify correct spec sections referenced for the trade scope
- Verify template standard clauses preserved unchanged
- Rate language quality on 1-5 scale

## Running Evals

```bash
# Run a single case
python evals/runners/run_eval.py --case evals/cases/schedule-extractor/case_01.json

# Run all cases for a skill
python evals/runners/run_suite.py --skill schedule-extractor

# Run everything
python evals/runners/run_suite.py --all

# Results written to evals/results/{timestamp}_{skill}.json
```

## Iteration Process

1. **Baseline**: Run all cases without any skill modifications → establish baseline scores
2. **Identify gaps**: Find the lowest-scoring cases → these reveal skill weaknesses
3. **Iterate**: Modify SKILL.md instructions, scripts, or prompts → re-run failed cases
4. **Regression check**: Re-run full suite to ensure fixes don't break other cases
5. **Expand**: Add edge cases discovered during iteration
6. **Document**: Record what changes improved scores and why
